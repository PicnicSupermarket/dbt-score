# Programmatic invocations

`dbt-score` can be used interactively as a CLI tool, but also be integrated in
Continuous Integration systems and anywhere else it makes sense.

## Machine-readable output

In order to programmatically use the output of `dbt-score` in another program,
the JSON formatter can be used:

```shell
$ dbt-score lint --format json
{
  "models": {
    "model1": {
      "score": 8.666666666666668,
      "badge": "ðŸ¥ˆ",
      "pass": true,
      "results": {
        "dbt_score.rules.generic.columns_have_description": {
          "result": "OK",
          "severity": "medium",
          "message": null
        },
        "dbt_score.rules.generic.has_description": {
          "result": "OK",
          "severity": "medium",
          "message": null
        },
        "dbt_score.rules.generic.has_owner": {
          "result": "WARN",
          "severity": "medium",
          "message": "Model lacks an owner."
        },
        "dbt_score.rules.generic.has_example_sql": {
          "result": "OK",
          "severity": "low",
          "message": null
        },
        "dbt_score.rules.generic.sql_has_reasonable_number_of_lines": {
          "result": "OK",
          "severity": "medium",
          "message": null
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "project": {
    "score": 8.666666666666668,
    "badge": "ðŸ¥ˆ",
    "pass": true
  }
}
```

## Exit codes

When `dbt-score` terminates, it exists with one of the following exit codes:

- `0` in case of successful termination. This is the happy case, when the
  project being linted either doesn't raise any warning, or the warnings are
  small enough to be above the thresholds. This generally means "successful
  linting".
- `1` in case of linting errors. This is the unhappy case: some entities in the
  project raise enough warnings to have a score below the defined thresholds.
  This generally means "linting doesn't pass".
- `2` in case of an unexpected error. This happens for example if something is
  misconfigured (for example a faulty dbt project), or the wrong parameters are
  given to the CLI. This generally means "setup needs to be fixed".
